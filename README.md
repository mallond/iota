IOTA Playground

# Comments
Jan 28th, 2018 - I have been playing with IOTA, sending and receiving coins. And as of today's date, I will  
take a breather for a bit. The API base is way to unpredictable and Slow. 
However, their technical specs, vision, and model is - Right on target of what the IOT API should be like. 
Will come back here in a few months.

# API Example Runs
